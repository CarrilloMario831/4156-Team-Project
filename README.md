### MySQL Database Setup
1. These steps are borrowed from Prof. Ferguson's [HW0 for W4111 Intro to DB](https://github.com/donald-f-ferguson/W4111-Intro-to-Databases-Base/blob/main/docs/Homework/HW0/HW0.md#mysql-server-community-edition). 
2. Install MySQL (Server) Community edition if you don't already have it. 
3. Write down and remember the root user ID and password. 
4. Choose Legacy Authentication method.
5. Here are some [useful commands](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing) to check if the MySQL daemon process is running in the background. 
6. Download any free trial of DataGrip or trying logging in with your school email
7. Connect DataGrip to your MySQL server (you'll need the root user ID and password); [here's a guide for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szK5sWGHgbw).
8. Open the sql_ddl.sql file, select all the text and hit the green execute button to create a database called
reservation management with 4 tables inside of it: Inventories, Inventory_Items, Items and Users. 
9. Now, you should be able to open any of the tables and find some data in them to start playing around with. 

* Note: I still need to figure out how to connect multiple items to a single inventory.
